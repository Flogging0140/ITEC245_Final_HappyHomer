# ITEC245 Final, Happy Homer

## Overview

This was the project for my ITEC 245 final. What is on GitHub if cloned would have to also be extracted. An SQL file is included if data from the DB is required to setup again. This is a demo of what I have been able to do with Razor Pages, SASS + BS5, Sql Server in Asp Net Core. Throughout the project I used Git for my version control, GitHub to push the data to the cloud for versioning. 

## Highlights

- Custom properties in Asp Net Users scaffolded table, done by inheriting from the Identity User and setting additional properties
- Sass was used to override Bootstrap 5 giving me a great starting point for styles but the ability to customize as needed
- Sql Server used with the code first approach, EFcore used as the ORM
- Microsoft individual user scaffolded basic authentication
- Modified scaffolded pages with custom styles
- SVG graphics used to give different feel on home page
- GPT4 autogenerated text, MJ5 created images for products

## Video Demo

I took the time to create, and edit a video with Kdenlive to demo the project. Basic functionality is covered in less than 10 mins at a non-technical level.
